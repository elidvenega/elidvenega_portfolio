      <h2>Doing a Todo list</h2>
      <p>
        Today on 19th of August I did a todo list in front of my friend to show
        what I had learned so far It was something that was pretty nerve
        wrecking. We set a location where we would meet and he would watch as I
        did this todo list on React after meeting at the coffee shop I opened up
        my editor and got started I had practice this project many times. So as
        soon I got with my friend I explained the steps and what I was doing
        explain how I was using react hooks and before in no time I had finishd
        the project and felt proud.
