      <h2>Doing a Todo list</h2>
      <p>
        Today on 19th of August I did a todo list in front of my friend to show
        what I had learned so far It was something that was pretty nerve
        wrecking. We set a location where we would meet and he would watch as I
        did this todo list on React after meeting at the coffee shop I opened up
        my editor and got started I had practice this project many times. So as
        soon I got with my friend I explained the steps and what I was doing
        explain how I was using react hooks and before in no time I had finishd
        the project and felt proud.

      <h2>Calling an API</h2>
      <h3>09/29/24</h3>
      <p>
        So I learned how to call an API and decided to show my friend and how I
        was doing it it was done in React and I was calling. The JSON
        placeholder API it was nerve wrecking but it gave me confidence that
        I'knew what I was doing using async await and useState and useEffect
        making sure doing it the right way.

      <h2>Doing a Todo List using useReducer and useContext</h2>
      <h3>10/30/24</h3>
      <p>
        I learned how to do a todo list using useReducer and useContext which
        was something pretty difficult to do. It was very different than just
        using useState I had to break the code into different files.

      <h2>I drew 100 times the same drawing</h2>
      <h3>07/15/25</h3>
      <p>
        I was feeling a bit down, and to cheer myself up, I decided to do
        something to distract myself. One of the things I'm passionate about is
        art, so I decided to start drawing every day. It has been a long time
        since I last drew anything. It was pretty challenging at first, nothing
        coming out the way I wanted it to. Over time, I saw progress, and my
        mood also improved, so I was glad I had started doing this. After a
        while, I decided to draw an anime character I liked without any
        guidelines, which proved to be extremely difficult. When I finished my
        100 drawings, the anime character did not come out the way I wanted it
        to, but I was happy regardless. Because I completed the goal I wanted to
        accomplish.
